# dbt learning project (Airbnb sample data)

This is a small dbt Core project that I built while learning analytics engineering. It uses a simple Airbnb sample dataset and runs transformations end to end in Snowflake.

The goal of the project is to understand how dbt structures models, applies tests and materialises tables, while practising a real workflow from staging to final marts.



## Project goals

* Learn the basics of dbt Core and Snowflake
* Connect dbt to Snowflake securely through a local profile  
* Create staging and transformed models from a single source dataset  
* Add basic data quality tests  
* Understand materialisations and dbt project structure  
* Run dbt commands from the terminal with confidence  



## Dataset

The project uses **sample Airbnb data** (hosts, listings etc).  
The data is stored locally in the project and loaded through dbt models.
